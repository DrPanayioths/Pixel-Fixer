It's a 2D Racing game. 

Work In Progress.

We need to make main.py work something like reference.py.

- /assets/
    - Assets such as music and stuff
- /src/ 
    - other game related scripts
    - /tleng2/ 
        - game framework scripts
## Running reference.py
- You can move with `WASD` 
- You can turn on the debug mode, that shows the hitboxes with `B`
- You can toggle the clarity of the car model with `V` 

### TODO

- Camera
- Renderer
